## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- [ ] ❌ Do NOT add mandatory gates everywhere
- [ ] ❌ Do NOT over-engineer rollback (simple snapshots suffice)
- [ ] ❌ Do NOT prematurely parallelize beneficial sequential phases
- [ ] ❌ Do NOT add excessive validators (focus on high-impact)
- [ ] ❌ Do NOT introduce breaking changes

---

## ✨ Core Strengths to Preserve

- [ ] ✅ Constitutional Articles (governance model)
- [ ] ✅ Hybrid Clarification Mode (speed + control balance)
- [ ] ✅ Test-First Discipline (strict enforcement)
- [ ] ✅ Anti-AI-Slop Design (market differentiator)
- [ ] ✅ Intelligent Defaults (expand to more areas)
